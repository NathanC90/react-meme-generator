# Meme Generator - An interactive web app from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home)

This my solution to the project Meme Generator from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home).
Besides Header, all the other styles are designed followed by the figma design [here](https://www.figma.com/design/MoLwFPHNHJVrzdFurxHzNV/Meme-Generator?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=bhy96hFJ5BQ4YoEC-0)

### Skills required
- Controlled components
- Fetch data / call API
- side effects in React
- Understanding of Funcitonal Programming in React

### My thought process
1. create all the components that are needed (In this case, only <Header /> and <Main /> are needed)
2. set up <Header /> and style it accordingly
3. set up <Main /> and style it with hard-coded data
4. Fetch 100 most popular memes from [imgflip](https://imgflip.com/api) and update the meme image
5. Since there's no shared data, I keep all the states & functions in Main component
